# GameCollection
A (simple) tool to organize your games.

## What does it do?
It's supposed to load your games from the database (MySQL), and shows a list. You can add, remove and edit games, which will be updated into the database automaticly. 

It's planned to support several interfaces (like Web, GUI, CLI), and more attributes for the games (like played yet, played date). Way in the future it would be nice to have the application crawl the interwebs and get current prices off ebay or amazon, maybe for selling games or for buying games, when it seems adaquate. 

## Requirements

* MYSQL++
* probably Linux - not tested in Windows!
